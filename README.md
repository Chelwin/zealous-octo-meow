This is a repo of OS programs.
It's my learning project, and I will be adding the programs every day, hence forth. 
This is mainly for my practice in os programming so do feel free to push your cotributions and also to shamelessly point to mistakes in mine! That's how I'll learn, you see. 
The topics that I will cover are: 
Scheduling Algorithms
Memory Types
File Allocations
Deadlock 
Page Replacement
File Organization
Shared Memory & IPC
Paging Techniques
Threading & Synchronization Application.

It's time I started working on cleaner and more optimized methods to implement these algorithms. The ones I've till yet coded aren't all mine. That was what at instructor at my college taught. I'm programming in C so better clean that skillset of mine and make good use of it. //garrulous talk ends.
