This is a repo of OS programs.
It's my leearning project, and I will be adding the programs every day, hence forth. 
This is mainly for my practice in os programming so do feel free to push your cotributions and also to shamelessly point to mistakes in mine! 
The order that I'll follow is: 
Scheduling Algorithms
Memory Types
File Allocations
Deadlock 
Page Replacement
File Organization
Shared Memory & IPC
Paging Techniques
Threading & Synchronization Application.
